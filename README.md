This App can connected to an ESP and get the data from it and show it into a graph. 
Primarily it is design to accept the heart beat in form of decimal numbers (0 to 1) that is provided by the ESP.

You can find the finished apk under app/releases 
To work properly a ESP or something similar is needed that transferes data in form of float/doubles that can be shown in the graph.

If you want to used it in an other ways just change the graph behavior in the RecordScreen Activity.
There also functins for writing implemented that can be used if needed.



In the root directory i also added the Arduino file that the ESP is using.
